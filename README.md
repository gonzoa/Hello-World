# Hello-World


  My Name is Astrid Gonzalez. I am a teacher that enjoys learning new things. When it comes to coding I have tried to learn a few different languages but it has never been successful... other than in scratch ^.^ I don't know how well this will turn out but I will try to code in Python and maybe HTML.
  
  THanks for givign this a read! :)
